building a real estate website MVP similar to Zillow using:

Frontend: React + Leaflet.js
Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL/PostGIS
Maps: OpenStreetMap for map tiles

1. Frontend-Backend Communication:
    Frontend uses RESTful API calls to the backend
    Authentication via JWT tokens
    Property data transfer in JSON format

2. Data Flow:
    Client sends requests to routes
    Routes direct to controllers
    Controllers use models for database operations
    Models access PostgreSQL/PostGIS database
    Results flow back through the same path

3. Geospatial Features:
    Frontend: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap
    Backend: PostGIS for spatial queries
    Integration: API endpoints for nearby properties

4. Authentication Process:
    Registration/login handled by auth controllers
    JWT tokens generated and verified
    Protected routes check authentication middleware

5. Property Management:
    CRUD operations for properties
    Image handling via dedicated service
    Geocoding converts addresses to coordinates
